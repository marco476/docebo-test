# Docebo Test by Marco Cante

## ‚úãÔ∏è Welcome

Hi, I'm **Marco Cante** and this is my Docebo test repository. I have to implement a reusable carousel component without JS libraries and frameworks and with a well commented/structured code.

I'm sincere: I have done the job quickly **due to lack of time**. For this reason i don't implemented some features that I would have liked to implement, like animations, transitions, unit test etc.

**I hope that can be a good job for you!**

## üò∏Ô∏è Demo page

You can download the repository on your pc and see the project:

1. `git clone git@github.com:marco476/docebo-test.git`
2. Go in `docebo-test` directory with your file manager and open `index.html` in your browser!

## üíªÔ∏è Develop and build

I developed a little and easy **build system** with Webpack for build JS/SASS assets.
You can build the library in two way:

1. `npm run build:dev` for develop build
2. `npm run build:prod` for production build

For develop mode, you can use **Webpack watch mode**:

- `npm run watch`

## üíÖÔ∏è Linter and prettier

Like you can see in the `package.json`, i used `prettier` and `eslint` as **code formatter and javascript linter**. You can use it with:

- `npm run prettier`
- `npm run lint`

You can see configurations files in the root project:

- `.eslintrc`
- `.prettierrc`
- `.prettierignore`

I use Git hooks with `husky` and `lint-staged` in the `pre-commit` for **automate some tasks** like `production build` and `prettier`!

## üëäÔ∏è Why Typescript?

I read several times this lines:

> Javascript code must be properly structured and well commented

> The usage of ECMAScript 2015 new constructs (templates, classes, Promises), code building
> tools [...] if the candidate is applying for a senior role.

So, i thought: typescript it's perfect for me, for this reasons:

1. I can develop a **robust/solid code** with strong types
2. I can describe the library and data models with **Interface** and **Type**
3. I can prove my **typescript skills**
4. I think that structure modeling and design with typescript is **much more better** that simple JS for scalability, code quality, strong types, errors avoiding and so on
5. I love Typescript ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üôèÔ∏è Thanks!

Thank you for the opportunity and for your interest in me.

Have a good day!

**Marco Cante**
